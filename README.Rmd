# Continued fractions

A continued fraction is an expression of the form

$$a_0 +\frac{1}{a_1+\frac{1}{a_2+\frac{1}{\ddots}}}=
a_0+\frac{1}{a_1+}\, \frac{1}{a_2+}\ldots$$

Such expressions are interesting and useful in a number of
mathematical applications.  A _generalized_ continued fraction is an
expression of the form

$$b_0 +\frac{a_1}{b_1+\frac{a_2}{b_2+\frac{a_3}{b_3+\ddots}}}
= b_0+\frac{a_1}{b_1+}\, \frac{a_2}{b_2+} \frac{a_3}{b_3+}\ldots$$

The contfrac package provides functionality to deal with both these.

## Installation

To install the most recent stable version on CRAN, use
`install.packages()` at the R prompt:

`R> install.packages("contfrac")`

And then to load the package use `library()`:

```{r}
library("contfrac")
```

## Package features

The package provides functionality for dealing with continued fractions.

```{r}
as_cf(pi,n=7)   # convert pi to continued fraction form
```

We can evaluate convergents of any sequence using ```convergents()```
or `nconv()`:


```{r}
convergents(1:8)
nconv(1:8)
```

The package uses standard IEEE arithmetic so is not reliable past a
certain point, shown here by expanding the golden ratio:

```{r}
as_cf((1+sqrt(5))/2,n=50)
```

## Further information

For more details, and some discussion of the mathematics of continued
fractions, see the package vignette.
